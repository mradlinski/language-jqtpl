# language-jqtpl

Support for JQTPL, a deprecated template language (https://github.com/kof/jqtpl), in Atom. Not all tags from the original package are supported, but there are some additional, custom ones.

Two separate grammars are included - for HTML (called simply JQTPL) and JS (JQTPL-JS) files.
